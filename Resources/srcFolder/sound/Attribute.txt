ATTRIBUTION INFORMATION

In order to use my work legally, you must credit me in your video, game, interactive novel, etc.…not merely on the info page on Youtube, Google Play, etc. (The reason is that people often don’t read the information section.)

FOR MUSIC:

If you are using only my music and not that of another artist(s) then your credits screen of your video, game, etc. needs to say:

If you are using my music tracks as well as tracks by other artist(s) then you need to identify which tracks are mine and credit me, for example:

“Invasion of the Giant Disco Ants”

“Too Quiet”

“Mayhem”
